This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper titled "Multiple Teachers-Meticulous Student: A Domain Adaptive Meta-Knowledge Distillation Model for Medical Image Classification." The research focuses on developing a domain adaptive meta-knowledge distillation model tailored for medical image classification tasks. The model described in the paper leverages the knowledge from multiple teachers to train a meticulous student model capable of achieving high accuracy and generalization across different medical imaging domains.
